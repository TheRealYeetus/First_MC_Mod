<H1>VitalityCraft</H1>
<H2> v0.3.2 </H2>
<p> (working title) </p>
<p> VitalityCraft is a WIP mod that adds several new items and blocks. The goal is to make a mod that builds off of the vanilla combat system, along with adding a few QOL changes. </p>
<h2> Basic concept </h2>
<p> Vitality is a form of ambient energy that can be used for many things. The health of the player, specifically the max health, is determined by vitality. 
  The max health of the player is 20, but through infusing vitality into the player, their max health can go far beyond the normal limits. </p>
  
<p> Vitality can also be negative. When positive vitality and negative vitality combine, they release a surge of energy and annihilate each other. This can be used as fuel or an explosive. </p>

<p> This brings us to Combat. </p>

<p> Vitality based combat is much more dependent on the player's skill and resources. Vitality makes up the player's health, so the most effective way of damaging someone is channeling vitality with a opposing polarity into them.
  During channeling, vitality is extracted from the air, so the damage done depends on the vitality of the chunk that the combat is taking place in. If the player doesn't want to rely on the vitality of their chunk for damage, 
  they can also store vitality in their inventory. </p>
  
<p> Later into the mod, you will be able to have two health bars, one positive (normal) and one negative. The two will have separate maxes.
  Damage and defense will also depend on the polarity of the player's health, so effectively swapping between them will be a useful skill. </p>
  
<p> They will also recieve various buffs and debuffs based on the polarity of the chunk in regards to the polarity of their health. These effects will NOT be affected by the vitality stored in their inventory. </p>
